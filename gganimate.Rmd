### gganimate
<https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate>

gganimate wraps the animation package to create animated ggplot2 plots.

```{r eval = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.show = "animate")
# Example from https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)

# For example, suppose we wanted to create an animation similar to the Gapminder 
# world animation, using Jenny Bryan's gapminder package for the data.
library(gapminder)

theme_set(theme_bw())
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent, frame = year)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()

# Notice we added frame = year and saved the plot as p. 
# We then display it as an animation with the gg_animate function:
gg_animate(p)
```
