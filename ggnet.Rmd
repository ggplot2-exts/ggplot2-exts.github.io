### ggnet
<https://github.com/briatte/ggnet>

ggnet implements network visualizations in ggplot2 via the ggnet and ggnet2 functions. It can be installed [from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGally/) as part of the GGally package, or [from GitHub](https://github.com/briatte/ggnet) as a standalone package.

See the [geomnet](geomnet.html), [ggnetwork](ggnetwork.html) and [ggraph](ggraph.html) extensions for other extensions that bring network visualization to ggplot2.

# random graph
net = rgraph(10, mode = "graph", tprob = 0.5)
net = network(net, directed = FALSE)

# vertex names
network.vertex.names(net) = letters[1:10]

ggnet2(net, size = 6, color = rep(c("tomato", "steelblue"), 5))
```
